ballpoint
=========

Websites change and sometimes you want to know when that happens and in particular
when something appears on it. Ballpoint is a URL listener and when that happens
it'll push you a notification that it happened.

A typical use case might be that you're interested in a particular website that
publishes special deals. You know that they generally update their website at
midnight on a Monday so you want particular attention paid at around about
that time. Ballpoint will monitor the website looking for a particular deal and
then should it appear it will notify you.

Authentication
--------------
Some websites require authentication and ballpoint handles that too.

Notification
------------
